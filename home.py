### Business Problem Statement:
**Optimizing Insurance Transaction Performance and User Engagement on Digital Platforms**

As PhonePe continues to expand its financial services, especially in the insurance sector, it becomes critical to leverage transaction and engagement data to derive key insights. The core challenge lies in understanding how various factors, including geography (state and district-wise performance), quarterly trends, and yearly performance, influence the growth and efficiency of insurance transactions on the platform.

This analysis will address the following key aspects:
1. **State-wise Performance:** Identify how geographical factors influence transaction volume and revenue, helping businesses focus on underperforming regions and enhance strategy.
2. **District-wise Trends:** Uncover high-performing districts and analyze how transaction volumes and amounts change over time, identifying regions with high growth potential.
3. **Brand-wise Insights:** Analyze brand-specific transaction trends to identify top-performing brands, measure market penetration, and support strategic decision-making for brand promotion.
4. **User Engagement:** Solve the issue of districts with high registered users but low app engagement by correlating `Registered_users` and `App_opens`, and formulating targeted marketing strategies to boost engagement.

By addressing these factors, the analysis will help optimize the performance of PhonePe's insurance transactions.
